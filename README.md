One Can simply run the script using params and voila the file is downloaded

Need to run the script with following params 
-u url -ep list_of_episodes_seperated_by_commas -q quality_at which_you_wish_to_download

Ex: python Fetch_data.py -u http://sv4avadl.uploadt.com/Serial/Silicon/S01/ -ep 1,2,3 -q 480p

If ep and q are not specified it will set as default


If anyone wants to improve one can do it.
